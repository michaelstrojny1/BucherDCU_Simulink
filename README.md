**Summary**

The **Bucher DCU** is a PMSM Vector Control Inverter. This repository contains a simulation of the inverter and a PDF describing the mathematical models used. Please see **Datasheet.pdf** for the Bucher DCU datasheet. You should read **Bucher_DCU_Math_And_Theory.pdf** start to finish to understand the math behind the simulation and what each simulation parameter does.

We implement the DCU as a Matlab Function Block. All parameters are doubles. The load torque, torque command and speed command are double time series (2xN matrix) and hv_ok is a boolean double. Units are: seconds, amps, volts, ohms, henries, farads, rad/s, Nm and kgm^2. Please copy the DCU Implementation (excluding the demonstration runner at the top) within the **Bucher_DCU_MLX_Demo.mlx** file into a Matlab Function block in your Simulink Simulation. You can use the demonstration runner within Bucher_DCU_MLX_Demo.mlx to play around with the DCU and potentially debug it if you choose to modify the simulation dynamics.

**Quick Background On Vector Control PMSM Inverters**

An inverter applies a 3-phase AC voltage to three windings in the stator. This creates a magnetic pole pair every 120 degrees, creating a rotating magnetic field vector with speed $\omega_e$; the poles of the rotor (rotating shaft) follow this vector with $\omega_m$. We can transform the 3-phase flux $abc$ into 2 dimensions $dq$: a $d$-axis pointing down a rotor north pole and a $q$-axis perpendicular to $d$, which creates torque. Since each stator current produces a magnetic field in one of the three directions $abc$, we project the current vector on $d$, $q$ (based on each current's influence on flux in these directions). The inductances $L_d$ and $L_q$ represent how easy it is to add flux in either direction. Since $i_d$ has no effect on torque, we usually just set it to 0 (unless $dq$ inductances are not equal, in which case it has influence). If DC voltage is too high, we decrease $i_d$ to reduce back EMF in $q$ and thus require a lower voltage to yield the same torque. This is called Field Weakening. To control our motor's speed or torque, we demand a certain torque value; either directly through torque mode or indirectly by modifying demanded torque using a PI loop until we get a desired speed.
